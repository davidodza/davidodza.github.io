Start it off with a [netDiscoverVM](https://github.com/davidodza/Pre-OSCP/blob/master/netdiscoverVM.bash). Which shows the IP address of our target machine (192.168.226.134).

   
The next step is to do some scanning. Sparta has a nice interface for nmap and nikto scans (when applicable).

The webpage on port 80 has a login screen. I use my [SQLi script](https://github.com/davidodza/Pre-OSCP/blob/master/LogonInjectionSQL.py) to try to break in.

When Username && Password == admin' # -> We are granted access.

First I try getting a reverse shell with netcat. I use both methods below to account for ingress and egress filtering. Neither work.

From here I check out the [Reverse Shell Cheat Sheet](http://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/shells/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet), I begin from the top with the BASH revere shell.

Now that I have a limited shell, I do some investigation. Let's get some system information:

Lets see what we can execute as root:

I decide to search for Linux 2.6.9 exploits and come accross one in Exploit-DB https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/9542/. I find it on github, change the URL to raw content, and download it on our target.

Compiling and running this exploit grants root!
