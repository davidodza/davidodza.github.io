This is a walk-through of CTF challenge [Kioptrix 1.2](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/kioptrix-level-12-3,24/). I downloaded the target VM image from vulhub and booted it in VMware. My source machine is a Kali Linux image, also running on VMware.

All my engagements start with netdiscover, which is why I scripted a smarter version I call [netDiscoverVM](https://github.com/davidodza/Pre-OSCP/blob/master/netdiscoverVM.bash). This shows the IP address of our target machine (192.168.226.193).

Then we use Sparta to run nmap and nikto scans on the target.

I try connnecting with SSH with a couple bogus passwords but it doesn't pan out.

I run dirb and notice that the target's phpmyadmin page is available.

My [SQLi script](https://github.com/davidodza/Pre-OSCP/blob/master/LogonInjectionSQL.py) gets us into phpmyadmin with no Password and Username == admin' or 1=1.

I don't find anything in phpmyadmin page. 

I start to click around the website. There are parameters set in the URL, which suggests possible SQL injection. After some trial and error, I find a parameter which appears to be injectable. 

Below I have condensed my SQLmap commands. 
1. Discover injectable parameter in URL, id.
2. Show databases available.
3. Show tables available in gallery database.
4. Dump data from the dev_accounts table in the gallery database. (SQLmap cracked the md5 hashes)

I use the dumped credentials to SSH into dreg and loneferret. Then I look for privilege escalation vectors. The binary at /usr/local/bin/ht is interesting because it's setuid bit is on, and appears to have root privileges.

Running the text editor HT as root, the idea will be to add /bin/sh to loneferret's sudoer permissions. Note: I switched users from dreg to loneferret because I recieved an error when running ht as dreg.

Use ALT+F to save the file after modification.

Now we check to see if our privilege escalation was successful. Looks good!
