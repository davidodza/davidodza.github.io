title: Automation Tools Detected
---
## A worth adversary

While using Automation Tools today, a website had the **audacity** to tell me they suspected me of using Automation Tools! A couple hours later I have gained the website's trust and am browsing automatically. without hassle. 

I'm leaving out the website and the security vendor that was circumvented.

_Stay tuned for the rest_ :)
